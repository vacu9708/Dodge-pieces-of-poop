## ⚒️Skills used
* C++, SMFL

## 🥅Your goal in this game
* You have to dodge as much poop as possible. 

## Game rule
* Dodging a piece of poop gives you 1 point.
* Getting hit by a piece of poop makes you lose 100 points. 
* When you lose all the points, you lose the game and your max score is shown. You can retry.
* The longer you survive, the faster the poop falls and the more poop falls, that is, the game gets more difficult (But there's a difficulty limit)

## Control
* Move : ⬅️ ➡️ ⬆️ ⬇️
* Jump : spacebar
